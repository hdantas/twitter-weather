Pig
	//1 + implement the quad-tree idea
		//1a - make a file with all the limits
		//1b - implement in Pig
		//1c - define grid resolution based on a threshold x
	1.5 + create file to preprocess/clean the incoming tweets (remove tabs and newlines)
	2 + make a list with all existing routes between every pair of blocks
		//2a - create basic UDF, outputing just 1 tuples
		//2b - edit UDF, to output bags instead of just the first tuple.
		//2c -  make sure inputs and output are in ordered bags (and test this inside the UDF) (otherwise sort by count)
		//2d - create output schema, so that later output tuple fields can be refered by name
		//2e - edit pig script to group and count each flow (commented out in the flows.pig script)
		2f - use time and other criterion to exclude some flows. 
		2g - review all work done so far and ensure workingness with some sample data
	3 + relate routes with weather
		3a - look at source weather (3 conditions)
		3b - look at destination weather (3 conditions)
		3c - look at delta (destination-source) weather (3 conditions)
	4 + find result
		4a - most influence on travel (source, destination or delta)
		4b - weather conditions influence
